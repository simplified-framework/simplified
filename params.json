{"name":"Simplified","tagline":"Base of Simplified  Framework","body":"Welcome to Simplified\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nSimplified is a MVC (Model/View/Controller) framework written in PHP and it's key feature is to be simply,\r\nbe smart and work with most installable Composer components/libraries. It comes with url routing, a database \r\nORM layer, support for simple PHP templates and support for twig and at last a integrated form builder.\r\n\r\n##### Installation\r\nTo install the Simplified framework you need to install (if not already) Composer at first:\r\n\r\n    $>php -r \"readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');\" | php \r\n    $>sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer \r\n    $>sudo chmod 775 /usr/local/bin/composer \r\n\r\nOnce Composer is installed, you can start the Simplified installation process:\r\n\r\n    $>composer create-project simplified/simplified YOUR_DIRECTORY \"1.0.*\"\r\n\r\n##### Simplified on your web server\r\nThe Simplified framework runs at best on apache web servers, here you need to activate the mod_rewrite module\r\nin the server configuration. If it's activated, you can view your installation on the url http://localhost or\r\ndirectly on your web server providers url.\r\n\r\n##### What's next?\r\nAt first, you need to know something about your application environment. To keep things simple and developer friendly,\r\nwe have created a directory structure to point you to several things:\r\n\r\n  - __app__\r\n     - __config__  \r\n       Used for your application configurations\r\n     - __controllers__  \r\n       Used for controllers\r\n     - __database__  \r\n       Used for migrations and seeds\r\n     - __i18n__  \r\n       Used for language translations\r\n     - __models__  \r\n       Used for databse models\r\n     - __resources__  \r\n       Used for views assets(scripts, (s)css and less files) and third party vendor files\r\n     - __storage__  \r\n       Used to store user sessions, sqlite databases and template cache files\r\n  - __public__  \r\n       The place where the index.php, .htaccess and generated css files/images are\r\n  - __vendor__  \r\n    component sub directories\r\n     \r\n##### Database configuration\r\nTo configure your database you have to edit/add a item in the configuration array.  \r\nThe first key is to make sure, the configuration can be found via a unique name, use \"default\" if you want this \r\nconfiguration as your default one. To setup other configurations, give them a name and tell the database connection this \r\nname - or set the connection name in your database model class.\r\n\r\n##### Language configuration\r\nTo configure translations, simply set the language variable to the one you want to use, and the default as fallback.\r\n\r\n##### Providers configuration\r\n\r\n##### Routes configuration\r\nTo configure the application's routes - the ones that are responsable to answer network requests - is very simple\r\nand easy to understand.\r\n\r\nThere is support for our tool named \"Simplified Build\" too, look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplified-build \r\nfor the installation and usage.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
